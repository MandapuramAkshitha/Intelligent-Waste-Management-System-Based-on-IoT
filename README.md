# Intelligent-Waste-Management-System-Based-on-IoT
This project proposes an innovative approach to waste management through the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Our system employs Infrared (IR) sensors to monitor the fill levels of waste bins in real-time. These sensors are strategically placed in various bins to detect and measure the amount of waste. The data collected by the IR sensors is then transmitted via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) to a central server. This transmission utilizes a SIM card in the GPRS module to send the information to a mobile application, providing users with immediate updates on the status of waste bins. This system aims to optimize waste collection schedules, reduce unnecessary pickups, and prevent overflow, thereby promoting a cleaner and more efficient urban environment. The use of IoT not only enhances the efficiency of waste management operations but also contributes to the sustainability of smart cities.
